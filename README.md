# StickyBoard ‚Äî Tablet-Focused Life Management Dashboard for Android

## üìå Overview

**StickyBoard** is a pen-first, always-on tablet dashboard that unifies notes, tasks, and events into one intuitive interface. Designed to replace a paper agenda and scattered apps, it combines a Post-it style board, an integrated calendar, and intelligent task management ‚Äî all accessible from a single full-page layout on your home screen.

StickyBoard is more than a note-taking tool. It integrates with productivity services (Google Calendar, Microsoft Teams, Google Tasks, etc.), offers handwriting recognition, and organizes your personal and work life with a clean, customizable view.

## üéØ Core Goals

* **Full-page dashboard** optimized for landscape tablet use.
* **Unified Post-it model**: Every item starts as a note, classified as Generic, Task, or Event.
* **Separation of views**:

  * **Note Board**: Generic notes only (no tasks/events).
  * **Task List**: All tasks, sorted by due date.
  * **Calendar**: Events and tasks with dates; optional work log view for dated notes.
* **Categories/Tags** for organizing notes into projects or themes.
* **Historical backdating** to log past work or events.
* **Secure storage** with encryption and backup.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```
